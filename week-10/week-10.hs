-- Haskell!
-- In the last lecture - you saw a lot of things that you s

-- Let's talk briefly about zip,
-- pattern matching...
-- ...and lambda functions.


-- What is this case of thing all about?

--drop 2 [1, 2, 3, 4]

-- Exercise 1: Write an implementation of drop.


-- Exercise 2: Write a function accepting a list of Integers and returning a tuple of two integer lists - odd and even.

--spltiPlz [1, 2, 3] =>>> ([1,3], [2])

-- Exercise 3: Let's write an fn that returns the number of occurrences of the smallest number in it.

--occurrencesMin [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1] =>>> 4

-- Exercise 4: Let's write a function that checks if a string starts with another,

--isPrefix "cat" "dog" => False
--isPrefix "ca" "cat" => True

-- Exercise 5: Can we really fast generalize it to if a string is contained in another?
