-- OMG, still doing Haskell! It won't go away!

--What did we cover in the lecture? Tuples, lists, vectors, genercis, helpers.
--So, how dow e manipulate lists? Operators - ":", "..", "++", "elem", head, tail, reverse, splitAt, length
--What are those generics again? huh?
-- Helper function syntax...blabla where blabla, and you can skip the type signature.
--And list comprehensions? Do we need examples? <-- We didn't get there

-- Exercise 1: Write a function that accepts an integer and returns a list  of its digits
-- toDigits 4242 =>>> [4 2 4 2]

-- Exercise 2: Write a function that would return the max of any two comparable arguments
--ourMax 1 3 =>>> 3
--ourMax "a" "c" =>>> c


-- Exercise 3: Let's write a function that accepts two ordered lists and merges them.
--merge [1, 3, 5] [2, 4, 6] =>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

-- Exercise 4: Mergesort is a safe answer to sorting algo questions. How does it work? Let's write it!

--mergesort [1, 3, 97, 8, 4] =>>> [1, 3, 4, 8, 97]
